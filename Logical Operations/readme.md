# Basic Logical Operations in CPU Simulation

Welcome to the Basic Logical Operations project within the Semester One CPU Simulator! This project is dedicated to implementing assembly programs for fundamental logical operations using the specified CPU simulation tool.

## Logical Operations Implemented

The following logical operations have been implemented:

1. **AND Operation**
   - Assembly program for simulating the AND operation on two user-entered numbers.

2. **OR Operation**
   - Assembly program for simulating the OR operation on two user-entered numbers.

3. **NOT Operation**
   - Assembly program for simulating the NOT operation on a user-entered number.

4. **XOR Operation**
   - Assembly program for simulating the XOR operation on two user-entered numbers.

5. **NOR Operation**
   - Assembly program for simulating the NOR operation on two user-entered numbers.

6. **NAND Operation**
   - Assembly program for simulating the NAND operation on two user-entered numbers.

## How to Use

1. Download the assembly programs for the desired logical operation.
2. Open your CPU simulation tool.

3. Load or import the assembly program into the CPU simulation tool.

4. Execute the program and observe the results in the CPU registers.
