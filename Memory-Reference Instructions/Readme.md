# Memory Reference Instructions in CPU Simulation

Welcome to the Memory Reference Instructions project within the Semester One CPU Simulator! This project is dedicated to implementing assembly programs for fundamental memory reference instructions using the specified CPU simulation tool.

## Memory Reference Instructions Implemented

The following memory reference instructions have been implemented:

1. **ADD Operation (Address Add)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the ADD operation, which adds the contents of a specific memory address to the accumulator.

2. **LDA Operation (Load Accumulator)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the LDA operation, which loads the contents of a specific memory address into the accumulator.

3. **STA Operation (Store Accumulator)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the STA operation, which stores the contents of the accumulator into a specific memory address.

4. **BUN Operation (Branch Unconditionally)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the BUN operation, which unconditionally branches to a specified memory address.

5. **ISZ Operation (Increment and Skip if Zero)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the ISZ operation, which increments the contents of a specific memory address and skips the next instruction if the result is zero.

## How to Use

1. Download the assembly programs for the desired memory reference instruction.
2. Open your CPU simulation tool.

3. Load or import the assembly program into the CPU simulation tool.

4. Execute the program and observe the results in the CPU registers.
