# Base Machine for CPU Simulation

Welcome to the Base Machine project within the Semester One CPU Simulator! This project provides the foundational base machine code to be used in conjunction with a CPU simulation.

## Base Machine Code

The base machine code is available in the `basemachine.a` file. This code serves as the fundamental architecture for subsequent projects within this CPU simulation repository.

### How to Use

To utilize the base machine code, follow these steps:

1. Download the `basemachine.a` file in the respective .cpu file.
2. Open your respective CPU simulation tool.  [Link to CPU Simulation Tool](https://cs.colby.edu/djskrien/CPUSim/)
3. Load or import the ` [Link to CPU Simulation Tool](https://cs.colby.edu/djskrien/CPUSim/)
` file into the CPU simulation tool.

## Issues and Feedback

If you encounter any issues or have feedback regarding the base machine code, feel free to open an issue in this repository. Your input is valuable for improving the simulation and addressing any potential concerns.

Happy simulating!
