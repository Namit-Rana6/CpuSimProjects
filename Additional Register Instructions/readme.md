# Additional Register Reference Instructions in CPU Simulation

Welcome to the Additional Register Reference Instructions project within the Semester One CPU Simulator! This project extends the functionality of the CPU simulation by implementing assembly programs for additional register reference instructions using the specified CPU simulation tool.

## Additional Register Reference Instructions Implemented

The following additional register reference instructions have been implemented:

1. **INC Operation (Increment Accumulator)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the INC operation, which increments the contents of the accumulator.

2. **SPA Operation (Skip on Positive Accumulator)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the SPA operation, which skips the next instruction if the accumulator is positive.

3. **SNA Operation (Skip on Negative Accumulator)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the SNA operation, which skips the next instruction if the accumulator is negative.

4. **SZE Operation (Skip on Zero Accumulator)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the SZE operation, which skips the next instruction if the accumulator is zero.

## How to Use

1. Download the assembly programs for the desired additional register reference instruction.
2. Open your CPU simulation tool.

3. Load or import the assembly program into the CPU simulation tool.

4. Execute the program and observe the results in the CPU registers.
