# Register Reference Instructions in CPU Simulation

Welcome to the Register Reference Instructions project within the Semester One CPU Simulator! This project focuses on implementing assembly programs for fundamental register reference instructions using the specified CPU simulation tool.

## Register Reference Instructions Implemented

The following register reference instructions have been implemented:

1. **CLA Operation (Clear Accumulator)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the CLA operation, which clears the accumulator.

2. **CMA Operation (Complement Accumulator)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the CMA operation, which takes the one's complement of the accumulator.

3. **CME Operation (Complement E Register)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the CME operation, which complements the E register.

4. **HLT Operation (Halt)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the HLT operation, which halts the CPU.

## Folder: register_reference_instructions

You can find the assembly programs for these instructions in the "register_reference_instructions" folder.

## How to Use

1. Download the assembly programs for the desired register reference instruction.
2. Open your CPU simulation tool.

3. Load or import the assembly program into the CPU simulation tool.

4. Execute the program and observe the results in the CPU registers.
