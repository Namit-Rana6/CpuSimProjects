# Circular Shift Register Reference Instructions in CPU Simulation

Welcome to the Circular Shift Register Reference Instructions project within the Semester One CPU Simulator! This project introduces assembly programs for circular shift operations, specifically CIR (Circular Right Shift) and CIL (Circular Left Shift), using the specified CPU simulation tool.

## Circular Shift Register Reference Instructions Implemented

The following circular shift register reference instructions have been implemented:

1. **CIR Operation (Circular Right Shift)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the CIR operation, which performs a circular right shift on the contents of the accumulator.

2. **CIL Operation (Circular Left Shift)**
   - Assembly program for simulating the CIL operation, which performs a circular left shift on the contents of the accumulator.

## How to Use

1. Download the assembly programs for the desired circular shift register reference instruction.
2. Open your CPU simulation tool.

3. Load or import the assembly program into the CPU simulation tool.

4. Execute the program and observe the results in the CPU registers.
